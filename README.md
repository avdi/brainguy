Brainguy is an Observer library for Ruby.

## Synopsis

```ruby
require "brainguy"

class SatelliteOfLove
  include Brainguy::Eventful

  def intro_song
    emit(:robot_roll_call)
  end

  def send_the_movie
    emit(:movie_sign)
  end
end

class Crew
  include Brainguy::Listener
end

class TomServo < Crew
  def on_robot_roll_call(event)
    puts "Tom: Check me out!"
  end
end

class CrowTRobot < Crew
  def on_robot_roll_call(event)
    puts "Crow: I'm different!"
  end
end

class MikeNelson < Crew
  def on_movie_sign(event)
    puts "Mike: Oh no we've got movie sign!"
  end
end

sol = SatelliteOfLove.new
# Attach specific event handlers without a listener object
sol.on(:robot_roll_call) do
  puts "[Robot roll call!]"
end
sol.on(:movie_sign) do
  puts "[Movie sign flashes]"
end
sol.events.attach TomServo.new
sol.events.attach CrowTRobot.new
sol.events.attach MikeNelson.new

sol.intro_song
sol.send_the_movie

# >> [Robot roll call!]
# >> Tom: Check me out!
# >> Crow: I'm different!
# >> [Movie sign flashes]
# >> Mike: Oh no we've got movie sign!

## Introduction

*Well, here we are again.*

Back with another of those block-rockin' READMEs!

*You know, I can just leave now.*

Sorry. It won't happen again.

*So, "Brainguy", huh. What's the deal this time?*

This is an Observer pattern library for Ruby. The name is a play on the
character from Mystery Sci---

*Yeah yeah blah blah nerd nerd very clever. What's it do?*

In a nutshell, it's a decoupling mechanism. It lets "listener" objects
subscribe to events generated by other objects.

*Kind of like the `observer` Ruby standard library?"*

Yeah, exactly. But this library is a little bit fancier. It adds a
number of conveniences that you otherwise might have to build yourself on top of `observer`.

*Such as?*

Well, the most important feature it has is *named event types*. Instead of a single "update" event, events have symbolic names. Listeners can choose which events they care about, and ignore the rest.

*What exactly is a "listener"? Is it a special kind of object?*

Not really, no. Fundamentally a listener is any object which responds to `#call`. The most obvious example of such an object is a `Proc`. Here's an example of using a proc as a simple listener:

```ruby
require "brainguy"

events = Brainguy::SubscriptionSet.new
listener = proc do |event|
  puts "Got event: #{event.name}"
end
events.attach(listener)
events.emit(:ding)

# >> Got event: ding

```

## Installation
